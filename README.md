# Netflix Fullstack Project

This project is a full-stack Netflix clone built using modern web technologies. It allows users to browse movies, watch trailers, and manage their accounts, mimicking the core features of Netflix. The project demonstrates a wide array of development skills from frontend design to backend architecture and database management.



## Project Overview

The **Netflix Fullstack Project** is designed to simulate Netflixâ€™s movie streaming platform with core functionalities such as movie browsing, viewing trailers, and managing user authentication. The project is divided into two main components:
- **Frontend:** Built using React.js.
- **Backend:** Built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for handling user data and API calls.
